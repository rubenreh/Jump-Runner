# Jump Runner

"Jump Runner" is a game created using Arduino, an LCD display (Liquid Crystal Display), and a pushbutton for control. This unique game combines the thrill of an endless runner with the simplicity of Arduino-based hardware, offering a fun and interactive gaming experience.

In "Jump Runner," players control a character who automatically moves forward on the LCD display. The objective is to jump over obstacles that appear on the screen by pressing the pushbutton at the right moment. The longer the player avoids obstacles, the higher their score.

The game features simple yet engaging gameplay. Players must time their jumps carefully to avoid colliding with obstacles. The LCD display shows the player's score and the character's position, creating a dynamic and immersive gaming experience.

One of the key features of "Jump Runner" is its use of Arduino's reset button to restart the game. If the player loses by colliding with an obstacle, they can simply press the reset button on the Arduino board to start a new game, adding convenience and ease of use to the gaming experience.

"Jump Runner" demonstrates the creative possibilities of Arduino in developing interactive games. By combining basic hardware components with creative programming, this game provides a fun and entertaining experience for players of all ages.
